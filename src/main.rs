// A multi-threaded Tokio runtime is unnecessary for a command-line application that
// mainly executes short-lived, mostly single-threaded tasks.  Using the default
// runtime spawns a worker thread per core which noticeably increases the memory
// footprint of the binary and might lead to the process being killed on
// constrained environments when users only want to display `--help` or `--version`.
//
// Switching to the `current_thread` flavour keeps the runtime single-threaded and
// lightweight while still allowing us to `.await` asynchronous operations when
// they are actually requested by the user.
//
// If in the future true parallel execution becomes necessary we can either
// create a dedicated multi-threaded runtime only for that specific operation or
// revisit this decision.
